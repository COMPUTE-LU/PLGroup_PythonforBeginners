# Peer-learning group "Python for Beginners"
Here we collect material for the peer-learning group Python for Beginners at Lund University. In case of questions, please contact the COMPUTE study director Sonja Aits who manages the group at compute[at]fysik.lu.se.

## Instructions for the kick-off

At the kick-off we will go through the organization of the peer-learning group and Rafsan Ahmed will present the first steps of python coding using the free google colab platform. To open the kick-off tutorial in colab, sign into a google account and click on the link you received by email. If you have trouble with your browser, switch to Chrome. When you enter the notebook for the first time, you should click “copy to drive”. That way, you can write and run your own code and save it!

More info on how to use colab here:

## Connecting to the peer-learning group
### Step 1:
After the kick-off  on Jan 27, you will be added to the "COMPUTE members" team on Microsoft Teams. After connecting, please click on the channel "PLG - Python for Beginners" and follow the welcome instructions. If you did not register with an LU student or employee address for the kick-off, you will receive an email with further instructions. 

Instructions for how to use Microsoft Teams can be found her: https://www.staff.lu.se/organisation-and-governance/coronaviruscovid-19-information-regarding-staffphd-doctoral-students/working-home-tools-and-tips/quick-guide-microsoft-teams

### Step 2:
#### For Lund University PhD students, Postdocs or employees:
To participate in the peer-learning group, you need to register as a COMPUTE member. To do this, simply submit the sign-up form according to the instructions on the COMPUTE website: http://www.compute.lu.se/

#### For LU Undergraduate students and people not affiliated with Lund University:
To participate in the peer-learning group, you need to register as a member of AI Lund and/or HubAI:

### Step 3:
Sign up for the "Crash Course on Python" on coursera. Choose the "Audit the course" option so it is for free.

https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course
 
Then follow the course at your own pace.

### Step 4:
Use the Teams channel to discuss with your peers, ask for help and report your progress. You can also share links, e.g. to your notebooks with coding projects or additional training material. Every second week we will also open a zoom meeting where you can meet (link is in the welcome message of the channel). You are free to organize additional meetings with the entire group or a few members, as it suits you. Once you have completed to course, get in touch with the group manager and we can move you to a "Advanced Python" group.


### Step 5 (optional):
